Setting up a regular dual boot configuration is quite easy. It is trivial if you are installing Linux on a partition of a Windows PC. It may be a little bit trickier the other way around. This is because [Windows will overwrite the boot sector](https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/68587/437761) with its (stupid) MBR, throwing GRUB out of the window. 

We can fix this either manually, or we could use [boot-repair](https://sourceforge.net/projects/boot-repair/). We need to add its PPA before installing it with `apt`:

{% include codeHeader.html %}
``` bash
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:yannubuntu/boot-repair
sudo apt update
sudo apt install boot-repair
```

To repair the boot sector, run `boot-repair` from the terminal and click on _Recommended repair_. Once finished, don't forget to run `sudo update-grub`.

That's it. You should now have a regular dual-boot configuration with Windows and your favorite Linux distribution side by side. In the next posts, we are going to see how we can turn into something much more interesting.
