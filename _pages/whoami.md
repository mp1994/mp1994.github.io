So, this is it. After a very long time _offline_, I finally went back to blogging. I liked the concept of _this_ being a <a href="https://github.com/mp1994/mp1994.github.io">GitHub repository</a>. I'm probably doing this wrong, but I also liked Jekyll and wanted to experiment it. I am not sure I can easily go back to HTML/PHP/MySQL as if all these years hadn't passed.

```c++
mp1994.get_whoami()
```

I am Mattia, `$year - 1994` years old, from Milan, Italy. I am biomedical engineer, and I am currently a PhD Student in Bioengineering at the _Politecnico di Milano_. But I don't think I will talk about this here.

I am a tech enthusiast, petrolhead, meme enjoyer. I have a thing for _The Office_. You can find me on TV Time (mp.1994) to check out what other shows I like. I started this blog mainly to support some projects that I recently started to publish on my <a href="https://github.com/mp1994/">Github</a>. Speaking of which, for now I am ending this page (I feel I've already talked too much about me) with my GitHub chart [1].
