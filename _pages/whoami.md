So, this is it. After a very long time _offline_, I finally went back to blogging. I liked the concept of _this_ being a <a href="https://github.com/mp1994/mp1994.github.io">GitHub repository</a>. I'm probably doing this wrong, but I also liked Jekyll and wanted to experiment it. I am not sure I can easily go back to HTML/PHP/MySQL as if all these years hadn't passed.
